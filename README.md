# Week-Long-Puzzle

## Seciont 1: Project Description

A web and email-based puzzle game that has users interfacing with various services available in AWS. Users will be required to subscribe to the program with their email at no cost in order to receive notifications about the next steps to the puzzle after the initial stepâ€™s completion. Each day, the user will be given a puzzle that increases in complexity that will require them to investigate various pieces of information given to them such as elements on a web-page, figuring out how to directly connect to a publicly hosted server for more information, understanding how to search for ciphers and where to recognize when are where to use them, and various other techniques.

## Section 2: Overview
### 2.1 Purpose
* Teach people various bits of information about ciphers, inspecting web pages, file handling, and other miscellaneous information related to interfacing with resources online
* Teaching is done through puzzles that progressively grow in complexity as they are completed
* The puzzles will be paced with each one given a day after the previous one has been completed in order to not overwhelm users with the amount of information that is immediately available with each step
### 2.2 Scope
* Information hosted on a website running on AWS servers
* Teaching how to, then requiring the user to search for resources online
* Emails will be given in order to give users the next step in progressing the puzzle
  * This requires users to subscribe to the email message service
* Potentially the ability to progress through each step on their own without receiving the email
  * Allows them to press a button to not receive the upcoming email
### 2.3 Requirements
- Feature 1: Website hosted through AWS
- Feature 2: Emails sent for the duration of only one week
- Feature 3: Pages that can be navigated to, each with information on how to interface with the puzzle
- Feature 4: Hidden components on the web page that are components of puzzles
- Feature 5: A total of Seven puzzles for each day, each puzzle may take multiple steps
- Feature 6: Tracking user progress on puzzles in order to trigger emails being sent
- Feature 7: Unsubscribing from emails

#### 2.3.1 Functional Requirements
1) Users are capable of signing up for the service with an email, password, and name to be referred as
2) Reading user input through buttons and text fields
3) Web page caches user information to load which page needs to be loaded at any given time for the puzzle
4) Hidden information on the web page for the sake of the puzzle to be found when the user inspects the page

#### 2.3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
1) The system is capable of almost instantly sending messages between the website and the server when prompts are sent
2) Any user-inputs are controlled to prevent potential errors

#### 2.3.3 Technical Requirements
